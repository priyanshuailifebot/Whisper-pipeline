3. Success stories
AI CoE facilitated digital adoption of the AI powered solution for the grain quality
inspection. The details are as follows:
Problem statement - Grain quality evaluation relies on manual and subjective
inspection, often leading to inconsistent results, lack of transparency, and unfair pricing
for farmers especially at local marketplace.
Solution: AI-based grain quality assessment system was introduced, capable of
evaluating over ten physical parameters of grains i.e. broken grains, foreign materials etc.
within 30 seconds using computer vision.
Impact: Deployed at APMCs in Kheda and Anand in Gujarat, it enables scientific, data-
driven decision-making at the grassroots level. The solution has empowered over 1,000
farmers and facilitated grain trade worth ₹700+ crore, ensuring fair pricing and reducing
losses from rejections. For more information, please refer to - https://youtu.be/
